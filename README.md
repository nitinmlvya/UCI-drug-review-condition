## Dataset

[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/drug+review+dataset+drugs+com)

### Task

Given a review, predict the underlying condition.

### Metrics

1. Accuracy
2. Confusion matrix (for top 10 classes in the dataset only, consider all other classes as â€˜otherâ€™)

### Instructions

- Prepare a python notebook/script with comments
- Choose the algorithm/model of your liking
- Metrics must be calculated on the **test set**
- Provide the accuracy and confusion matrix numbers in a separate file (.txt)
- Please create a zip package and email the results at **kunal.saluja@contentfly.com**
    - You can also provide a GitHub link
- Candidates will be ranked on a scale from 0-25. Points will be awarded for:
    - Code structure and cleanliness [3]
    - Comments [2]
    - Accuracy metric [5]
    - Confusion matrix [5]
    - Explanation during the interview: [5]
    - Bonus [5]
